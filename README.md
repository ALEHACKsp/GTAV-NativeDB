<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PujxsxF.png" width="500" align="right">

A native reference for Grand Theft Auto V built with React. Inspired by FiveM's reference with a few improvements.

- Cuickly jump to a namespace.
- Uses [Alloc8or's native data](https://github.com/alloc8or/gta5-nativedb-data) which is more up-to-date and has the correct naming for all of the namespaces.
- Ability to generate a native header file.
- Namespace name is sticky so you always now what namespace you're viewing.
- Works offline and is isntallable as an PWA
